# :mortar_board: Image Forgery Detection with CNNs
In our day and age, we have witnessed an unprecedented growth of digital images, a trend which has been made possible by the numerous devices around, such as smartphones and tablets. Moreover, the development of user-friendly image manipulation software that is available at reasonable prices, has made the manipulation of such content easier than ever. In particular, some of these images are tampered in such a way that it is impossible to detect even by humans. Over and above, social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter have turned the distribution of those images to the mass into a trivial task. While tampering processes, such as image contrast adjustment and skin smoothing, are harmless, there are others that could create serious business or political issues.

Based on the aforementioned, it becomes apparent that the development of automated methods that detect such manipulated images is of paramount importance. The term used in literature for this issue is image forgery detection.

An example set of images is given in Figure 1. More specifically, this task can be broken down into smaller sub-tasks depending on the way that the image has been manipulated. Three of the most common manipulations in literature are:

- Copy-move: a specific region from the image is copy pasted within the same image.
- Splicing: a region from an authentic image is copied into a different image.
- Removal: an image region is removed oved and the removed part is then in-painted.
